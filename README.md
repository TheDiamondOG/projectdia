# Project Dia Website
This is the website to show off the random crap I do, with some other stuff.\
\
The reason why the website got put on github was because I wanted to cut costs and just have it hosted for free. The downside is that I lost my python flask backend, and now have to completely deal with html and js, when I suck at js so hopefully I can make this still work.\

# Page List
Here is just a simple page list that might not get update
